Air New Zealand's Grabaseat is releasing 1000 domestic flights at just $9 one-way this morning.

It comes three days after the airline slashed fares across the Tasman to as low as $69 in a bid to fill seats and just hours after it halved the number of flights to Samoa.

Chief revenue officer Cam Wallace said the domestic fares, which are available from 9am Monday, were in response to softening demand as a result of coronavirus.

"On Monday we'll be offering these absolutely outstanding one-way fares to all of our 20 domestic destinations," he said.
